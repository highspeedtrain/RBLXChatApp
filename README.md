# RBLXChatApp
Don't want to give your face to a billion dollar corporation being sued for using your data to train AI?
use this chat app

Chat will automatically find the server id, game and account that you're playing and connect you to any other players in the same server.

# How to Use
Install (see below)
Open the .exe and join a Roblox game
Click "Attach"
Wait until the chat says "[Server]: Connected to WS"
You can then use chat as normal, type in the box, press enter to send message.
After leaving, press Unattach.

# Moderation
Currently, there is no chat filter.
However, slurs, hate speech, harrasment, homophobia, racism will not be tolerated.
Moderators will issue IP bans for those who partake in this behaviour.

# Installation
